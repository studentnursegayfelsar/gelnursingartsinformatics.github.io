<br>
        <p><b>Abruptio placenta or placental abruption</b> is the <i>early separation of a placenta from the lining of the uterus before the completion of the second stage of labor.</i> It is one of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy and places the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk.</p>
<br>
	<p>A thorough history and physical examination are required to differentiate between placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a firm diagnosis of placental abruption can only be determined after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are essential for the care of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a <i>life-threatening condition.</i> As a result, a correct assessment of the patient is essential for formulating an effective therapy plan and avoiding a possibly negative outcome.</p>
<br>
	<p><b>Placental abruption</b> occurs when the <i>maternal arteries separate from the placenta,</i> resulting in bleeding between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As blood collects, the uterine wall and placenta separate. The placenta provides the fetus with oxygen and nourishment while also excreting waste materials. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is crucial for the placenta's life-sustaining capabilities. When blood accumulates and separates the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these important placental activities are stopped. If the fetus does not obtain adequate oxygen and nutrition, it will die.</p>
<br>
	<h2><b><i>The clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent of the separation and the location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:</i></b></h2>
      <br>
	  <h3><b>Class 0: Asymptomatic</b></h3>
<ul>
	     <li> Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta</li>
	     <li> Diagnosis is made retrospectively</li>
</ul>
    <br>
	  <h3><b>Class 1: Mild</b></h3>
<ul>
	     <li> No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.</li>
  	     <li> Slight uterine tenderness</li>
  	     <li> Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL</li>
  	     <li> No signs of fetal distress</li>
</ul>
     <br>
<ul>
	  <h3><b>Class 2: Moderate</b></h3>
	     <li> No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding</li>
  	     <li> Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions</li>
  	     <li> Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure</li>
  	     <li> Evidence of fetal distress</li>
  	     <li> Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia</li>
</ul>
      <br>
	  <h3><b>Class 3: Severe</b></h3>
<ul>
	     <li> No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding</li>
  	     <li> Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation</li>
  	     <li> Maternal shock</li>
  	     <li> Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy</li>
  	     <li> Fetal death</li>
</ul>
<br>
	<p>Classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with a partial, marginal separation, whereas classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.<p>
	<br>
    <h2><b>Signs and Symptoms:</b></h2>
<br>
	<h3><i> Placental abruption is most likely to occur in the last trimester of pregnancy, especially in the last few weeks before birth. Signs and symptoms of placental abruption include:</i></h3>
<ul>
	     <li> Vaginal bleeding, although there might not be any</li>
  	     <li> Abdominal pain</li>
  	     <li> Back pain</li>
  	     <li> Uterine tenderness or rigidity</li>
  	     <li> Uterine contractions, often coming one right after another</li>
</ul>
<br>
	<p> Abdominal pain and back pain often begin suddenly. The amount of vaginal bleeding can vary greatly, and doesn't necessarily indicate how much of the placenta has separated from the uterus. It's possible for the blood to become trapped inside the uterus, so even with a severe placental abruption, there might be no visible bleeding.</p>
<br>
	<p> In some cases, placental abruption develops slowly (chronic abruption), which can cause light, intermittent vaginal bleeding. Your baby might not grow as quickly as expected, and you might have low amniotic fluid or other complications.</p>
	<br>
      <h2><b>Risk Factors of Abruptio Placenta:</b></h2>
<ul>
	     <p><li> <i>Trauma or Injury</i> - A direct injury or trauma to the abdomen, such as from a car accident or a fall, can increase the risk of placental abruption.</li></p>

  	     <p><li> <i>High Blood Pressure</i> - Chronic hypertension or preeclampsia can contribute to placental abruption.</li></p>

  	     <p><li> <i>Smoking</i> - Smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of placental abruption.</li></p>

  	     <p><li> <i>Multiple Pregnancies</i> - Women carrying twins or higher-order multiples have a higher risk of placental abruption.</li></p>
  	     <p><li> <i>Advanced Maternal Age</i> - Women who are older, particularly those over 35, may have an increased risk.</li></p>
	     <p><li> <i>Previous Incidence</i> - If a woman has experienced placental abruption in a previous pregnancy, there is a higher risk in subsequent pregnancies.</li></p>
  	     <p><li> <i>Uterine Distension</i> - Rapid uterine distension, often seen in pregnancies with polyhydramnios, can increase the risk.</li></p>
</ul>
<br>
  <h2><b>Therapeutic Management:</b></h2>
<br>
	<p><i>Placental separation is an emergency because it poses a risk to both the mother and the fetus (Heavey & Dahl Maher, 2015).</i></p>
<br>

<br>
	<p>To avoid fetal anoxia, a woman must introduce a large-gauge intravenous catheter for fluid replenishment and mask-based oxygenation. Set baselines and follow development by externally monitoring fetal heart sounds and recording the mother's vital signs every five to fifteen minutes. Other discoveries will be made till the moment of delivery, in addition to the baseline fi-bringen determination. To prevent putting strain on the vena cava and interfering with fetal circulation, a mother should remain lateral rather than supine. It is vital to avoid upsetting the damaged placenta any longer. As a result, never examine a woman's belly, vagina, or pelvis if a placental separation has been verified or suspected.</p>
<br>
	<p>If a vaginal birth does not appear to be imminent, a cesarean section is the preferable delivery method. If DIC has developed, a cesarean birth may be exceedingly dangerous since bleeding from the surgical incision can occur both during and after the surgery. A woman's fibrinogen level can be boosted intravenously before and during surgery by injecting fibrinogen or cryoprecipitate, both of which include fibrinogen. In the worst-case situation, avoiding exsanguination may necessitate a hysterectomy.</p>
<br>
	<p>The severity of prenatal hypoxia and the amount of placental separation impact the fetal prognosis. The mother's prognosis relies on how soon therapy can begin. Massive bleeding that causes shock and circulatory collapse, as well as circulatory collapse-induced renal failure, can be deadly.</p>
<br>
	<h3><i>Pregnant women who have had bleeding have a greater risk of infection after childbirth than other women. To avoid infection during the postpartum period, a woman with a history of premature placental separation must be closely monitored on a regular basis.</i></h3>
